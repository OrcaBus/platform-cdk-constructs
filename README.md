This repository contains reusable AWS CDK constructs for the OrcaBus platform. These constructs simplify the creation
and management of AWS infrastructure components while following best practices and OrcaBus-specific configurations.

## Repository Structure

This monorepo is organized as follows:

- **`packages/`** â€“ Contains reusable CDK constructs, such as `api-gateway` and `deployment-stack-pipeline`. These packages are published to the npm registry.
- **`dev/`** â€“ A development workspace for testing and experimenting with the constructs.
- **`.github/workflows/`** â€“ Contains GitHub Actions workflows for automating releases to the npm registry.

The repository is structured as a pnpm workspace with two workspaces:

1. `packages/` â€“ For CDK constructs that will be published to the npm registry.
2. `dev/` â€“ For development and testing purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the correct Node.js version installed:

```sh
node --version
# Expected output: v22.9.0
```

Set up `corepack` (if not already enabled):

```sh
npm install --global corepack@latest
corepack enable pnpm
```

### Install Dependencies

To install all required dependencies across workspaces, run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Development

Navigate to the `dev` directory:

```sh
pnpm clean
pnpm i
cd dev
```

Use the predefined pnpm script to run CDK commands:

```sh
pnpm cdk <command>

```

### Documentation

This packageâ€™s documentation is automatically generated in Markdown format using [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) and [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown).  
To regenerate the documentation, run:

```sh
pnpm packages:generate-docs
```

The documentation follows the JSDoc convention and can be viewed locally at:  
[ðŸ“„ View Generated Documentation](./packages/docs/README.md)

Additionally, [constructs.dev](https://constructs.dev/) automatically indexes packages compiled with the JSII compiler (as this package is). Once published to the npm registry, the documentation is also available on their site:

### Publishing

A GitHub Action is configured to automatically publish to the npm registry when a release is created.

To publish manually, ensure the following environment variables are set:

- `NPM_ACCESS_LEVEL`
- `NPM_TOKEN`

Then, build, package, and publish the constructs:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm package
pnpm publish
```

Alternative, you may push a new release to the `main` branch. This will trigger the GitHub Action to publish the package automatically.

i.e

```shell
git pull origin main
git checkout main

gh release create 0.0.10-alpha.0 --title '0.0.10-alpha.0 release!' --notes-file 'release-notes.md'
```
